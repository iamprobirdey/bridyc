    <h6 class="text-uppercase">Bridge your chaos</h6>
    <p>Not everyone of us is blessed enough to have the right exposure before choosing our paths 
    and that creates a lot of chaos. Been there, faced ourselves and we say, "NO MORE". Bridyc is a 
    bi-directional platform that works for both  students/parents and institutes and help them 
    ease a lot of the processes. We are dedicated to empower young minds with the real life exposure and activities 
    who are looking for cross-training their minds before choosing an institute or a career.

    <h4 class="text-uppercase">our mission</h4>
    <p>Every student is uniquely smart. We believe that the right exposure and the right information can lead them to 
    a happy decision. Bridyc is determined to expose you to all the possible career options, the real life skills and activities, helps you learn, unlearn, 
    relearn and share your learnings  with peer group of students.</p>

     <h4 class="text-uppercase text-lg-right">how do we do it?</h4>
     <p>We constantly research and post about all the possible and underrated career options 
     and the way to pursue them. We host podcast with people who have already crossed those 
     paths and are happy and successful in their career. We do have a forum section where 
     we try to have maximum discussion and also encourage students to have peer involvement 
     to solve each otherâ€™s doubts. Also, with the help of one click application, we totally 
     ease the process of applying to different institute at the same time.
